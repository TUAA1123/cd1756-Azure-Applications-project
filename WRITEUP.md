### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

ANSWER : Both options are applicable for this project. 
I would go with App Service as 
Cost - Its a small project with a short lifespan , therefore app service pay as you method is most efficient option.
Scalability - Again not many users, so no need to scale - app service is sufficient.
Workflow - the app is quite simple and doesnt require complex workflows so app serivce is more enough. 




### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

ANSWER: If we require to open this to multiple groups of users at a wider scale , also add more functionalites that would require maybe role level permissions , then a VM would be more applicable as it would give us the flexisbility to customize and the cost would be justfiied.
